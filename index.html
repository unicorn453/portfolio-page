          Hi, there, welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Kirila Ruseva, and
          I am a Front-End Web Developer. I have always been passionate about
          computer science, which is what led me to pursue a career in UX
          design. I have gained extensive experience in Java Script ES6+, CSS3,
          HTML5, SQL, React, Node, Query, and Bootstrap throughout my career. I
          have had the opportunity to work with some amazing individuals and
          organisations. <br />
          <br />
          I am proud to have been accredited with an edX certificate in
          Front-End Development. I am always looking for ways to improve my
          skills further and contribute to the success of my team and
          organisation. <br />
          <br />
          You can usually find me in the library when I'm not working, where I
          like to read history-related books and biographies. I also enjoy
          working out, dancing, and spending time with family and friends. I
          believe it's essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance and
          always make time for the things that matter most in life.
